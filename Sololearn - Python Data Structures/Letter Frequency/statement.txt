Letter Frequency


You are making a program to analyze text.
Take the text as the first input and a letter as the second input, and output the frequency of that letter in the text as a whole percentage.

Sample Input:
hello
l

Sample Output:
40

The letter l appears 2 times in the text hello, which has 5 letters. So, the frequency would be (2/5)*100 = 40.
